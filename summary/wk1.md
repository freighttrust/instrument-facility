<h1>Week 1 Summary</h1>

<p>During the first week of development on Blockarray's Bill of Lading application, we made considerable progress in specifying the API 
   that will be provided by the Dapp and in determining the smart contract interface. The smart contract layer has been completely specified
   and includes several non-fungible interfaces and several proxy contract interfaces. A Swagger document was produced that fully documents 
   the API endpoints that will be available, and an initial version of the endpoints was implemented that will allow for automated tests 
   to be written next week.  Additionally, we created a server startup script that starts and configures the server with the correct Web3 provider.
   We accomplished our goals for the week and are slightly ahead of scheduled.</p>
