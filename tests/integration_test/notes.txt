Valid Server Setup:

1. Deploy the NFT and Master Proxy contracts 
2. Deploy the Universal Proxy contract with the Master Proxy's address and an
   admin address (this should be a human account) as input
3. Deploy the Controller contract with the Universal Proxy's address and an admin
   address (the same address as in step 2) an input
4. Call `changeController` through the Universal Proxy from the admin address. 
   The controller should be changed to the controller address deployed in step
   3. 

Steps 1-3 cannot be performed through the API. Step 4 can if the `controller_address` 
is originally set to equal the `universal_address`. This solution is not ideal, 
so all of steps 1-4 should be completed during server setup.
